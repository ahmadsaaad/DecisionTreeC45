# DecisionTreeC45
1.	Load_data(): It loads the file into dataframe and return the dataframe along with the label of target label. 
2.	Main(): I shuffle the input dataset and then choose the rows from 0 to 100 for training data and from 101 to 150 for testing data. 
3.	The out: on the screen you will get 10 records, every record will show the the accuracy of my implementation against the one I got from Sklearn decision tree for the same training and testing data. Moreover, you will get a file created for every attempt contains the predicted data from my implantation, Sklearn decision tree and the input data. The wrong attributes in the predicted files will be between ().
